# **App Name**: Video Translator

## Core Features:

- Video Upload & Config: Allow users to upload videos and select target translation language, voice, and video quality.
- Audio Extraction & Transcription: Extract audio from the uploaded video and transcribe it into text using AI. The tool will then use this information in subsequent features.
- Text Translation: Translate the transcribed text into the user-selected target language using AI.
- PDF Generation: Generate a PDF document of the translated text.
- Video Generation: Overlay translated audio onto the original video to create a translated video.
- Downloadable Media: Provide downloadable links for both the translated PDF and the translated video.
- Progress Tracking: Display real-time updates on the processing stage with a progress tracker, to notify users when a process completes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3B5998), reminiscent of film and seriousness of translating the video.
- Background color: Light blue (#D8E9F5), creating a calm, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FFB347) to draw attention to the main actions.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a techy, scientific feel.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look. Pairing with Space Grotesk, Inter is very readable in large blocks of text.
- Use flat style icons to represent different actions like upload, download, language selection, and progress.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with clear calls to action. Utilize cards to present video options and processing steps.
